            <h2>Bindu Chakra - Moon Centre</h2>


            <article>

                <p>

                    <span>Bindu = point, drop</span>
                    The Bindu Chakra is situated beneath the whirl of hair at the tip of the head. In the picture of the
                    Bindu is a Lotus with twenty-three petals. Its symbol is the moon, which supports the growing of
                    vegetation. Lord Krishna said: “Becoming the nectarine moon I nourish all plants” (Bhagavad Gita
                    XV/13). Its Divinity is Lord Shiva, who is always portrayed with the crescent moon in his hair. The
                    Mantra is SHIVOHAM. This Chakra is colourless and transparent. <br><br>

                    The Bindu Chakra is an important centre for health, giving us the power for physical and mental
                    recuperation. This Chakra benefits eyesight, quietens the emotions and promotes inner harmony,
                    clarity and balance. With the help of this Chakra we are capable of controlling hunger and thirst
                    and gain the ability to overcome unhealthy eating habits. Concentration on the Bindu relieves
                    anxiety and depression, nervousness and also feelings of oppression in the heart.<br><br>

                    The Bindu Chakra bestows physical and mental health, vitality and youthfulness, because it produces
                    “the nectar of immortality” (Amrita). This nectar usually drops into the Manipura Chakra where it is
                    burned by the digestive fire without being fully utilised by the body. For this reason the Rishis of
                    ancient times sought a method to collect this valuable nectar and discovered that the flow of nectar
                    can be arrested with the help of the tongue and Vishuddhi Chakra. The tongue contains subtle energy
                    centres, each corresponding to an organ or area of the body. In the Yoga techniques of Ujjayi
                    Pranayama and Khechari Mudra, the tongue curbs the flow of nectar and stores it in the Vishuddhi
                    Chakra. Like a homeopathic medicine it is then redistributed throughout the whole body via the
                    subtle energy channels, where its healing effects unfold.

                <h2>Characteristics of Moon Chakra</h2>
                <p> Bindu holds our life force within. It is the center of where our life nectar, AMRITA, is produced.
                    Amrita is said to help the yogi obtain enlightenment. From there, this nectar drops down toward the
                    third chakra, Manipura.</p>

                <p>In the Manipura chakra, the life nectar from the Bindu chakra is being used up for various activities
                    of our body. In other words, the fire of Manipura (the name Solar Plexus Chakra is not given by
                    chance) is responsible for burning up and gradually using the nourishing powers of the AMRITA
                    nectar.</p>
                <p> Bindu Chakra is one of the most mysterious and remarkable energy centres within our human being.

                    Bindu Chakra is associated with the Pineal gland, it is our DNA receptor, it sends and receives our
                    wisdom to and from our soul on a daily basis . . . so, at night, in your dreams you are sending your
                    wisdom to your soul . . . and with daily practices in which we respect this incredible gift, our
                    gift in return is the brain-mind manufacturing hormones which help us to relax, go to the sweetspot
                    as we do in savasana and yoga nidra, feel feelings of deep bonding and security, and sleep deeply. A
                    reminder once again, if we needed it, of the incredible workings of the Ultimate Mind of the Divine.
