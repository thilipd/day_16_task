                <h2>Vishuddhi Chakra - Throat Centre</h2>
                <span>Visha = impurity, poison suddhi = purify</span>



                The Vishuddhi Chakra is situated in the throat. Its Mantra is HAM. The colour of Vishuddhi is purple. In
                this Chakra our consciousness reaches the fifth level. The corresponding element is Akasha (space). “We
                may also find this translated as “Ether”, which suggests this space should be filled with energy. The
                Vishuddhi Chakra is the starting point of Udana Prana. It is a function of this Prana to purify the body
                of toxic substances while breathing. The name of the Chakra is derived from this particular function.
                Purification not only occurs on the physical level, but also on the level of the psyche and mind. All
                problems and unpleasant experiences that we have “swallowed” and suppressed during the course of our
                life, continue to exist in the subconscious mind until they are faced and resolved with wisdom. <br><br>

                The Divinity of the Vishuddhi Chakra is Brahma, the Creator, the symbol of Consciousness. In meditation
                when individual consciousness is dissolved in Akasha, we attain Knowledge and Wisdom. The animal
                designated to represent Vishuddhi Chakra, is a White Elephant. We also find in this picture an image of
                the moon, symbolic of the mind.<br><br>

                The Vishuddhi Chakra unleashes an unlimited feeling of happiness and freedom that allows our abilities
                and skills to blossom. Along with this stage of development there is a clear voice, a talent for singing
                and speech, as well as balanced and calm thoughts.<br><br>

                Until this Chakra is fully developed, certain difficulties may be experienced. Blockage of the Vishuddhi
                Chakra produces feelings of anxiety, lack of freedom, restriction, thyroid and throat problems. There
                may be physically unfounded manifestations of swallowing problems and speech impediments.<br><br>

                In the symbolic picture of Vishuddhi Chakra is a Lotus with sixteen petals. These represent the sixteen
                potential abilities (Klas) that a human can develop. Since the Vishuddhi Chakra is the centre of sound,
                the number sixteen can also represent the sixteen vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet. Vak Siddhi may be
                realised in this centre, which is the extraordinary ability to have the words that one speaks come
                true.<br><br>

                <h2> The Characteristics of Vishuddha Chakra</h2>
                <h3>The expressive element of blue</h3>
                <p> The blue color element of the fifth of the seven chakras explores all levels of self-expression.
                    Blue is the color of communication, providing us with the power of speaking the truth. Blue is also
                    at the cooler end of the spectrum of colors. Blue allows the body and mind to experience stillness.
                    It represents a pure mind that is uncluttered from any negative thought.</p>

                <h3>Expand your mind with the element of Akasha</h3>
                <p>The element of Vishuddha Chakra is Akasha or space. Space opens the possibility of an expansion of
                    perspective. It symbolizes the energy of seeking and speaking the truth. Vishuddha also governs our
                    internal communication with our true Self. When this chakra is balanced, we are able to listen to
                    the guidance of pure energy. We are able to understand others deeply and effectively.</p>

                <h3>Signs of a Blocked Throat Chakra</h3>

                <p>When the energy of the Vishuddha Chakra is imbalanced, communication breaks down. We refuse to listen
                    to our inner Self and to others. Others are unable to understand us and feelings of loneliness
                    surround us. The symptoms of a disturbed Throat Chakra are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hesitation in expressing emotions</li>
                    <li>Lacking the vocabulary to describe your feelings</li>
                    <li> A sense feeling misunderstood by people around you</li>
                    <li>Aggressive behavior</li>
                    <li>Use of negative words and actions</li>
                </ul>

                <p> Since the Vishuddha Chakra is connected to the throat, there are visible physical problems due to
                    imbalance. A sore throat, fluctuations in hormone levels, and pain or stiffness in the neck area can
                    be symptoms of a misaligned Throat Chakra.</p>

                <h2>Positive affirmations for Throat chakra balance</h2>
                <p>The repetition of affirmations sets the intention to break old patterns and create new, healthier and
                    more effective, ones. To balance the Throat Chakra, repeat affirmations that relate to authenticity
                    and open communication. Here are some examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I communicate confidently and with ease.</li>
                    <li>I feel comfortable speaking my mind.</li>
                    <li>I am balanced in speaking and listening.</li>
                    <li>I am an active listener.</li>
                    <li>I speak my true thoughts with clarity.</li>
                    <li>I set clear boundaries.</li>
