            <h2>Ajna Chakra - Eyebrow Centre</h2>

            <article>



                <p><span>Ajna = command, knowledge</span>


                    The Ajna Chakra is situated in the middle of the forehead, between the eyebrows. For this reason it
                    is also known as the “third eye”. The Ajna Chakra is the centre of clarity and wisdom. It forms the
                    boundary between human and Divine consciousness. It is the meeting point of the three principle
                    Nadis, Ida (Moon Nadi), Pingala (Sun Nadi) and Sushumna (Central Nadi). When the energy of these
                    three Nadis unites here and rises further, we attain Samadhi, Supreme Consciousness. <br><br>

                    Its Mantra is OM. The colour of Ajna is white. Its element is the element of the mind, Anupada
                    Tattva. Its symbol is a white Shiva Lingam, representative of creative consciousness. In this and
                    all subsequent Chakras, there are no animal symbols. At this level, only pure, human and Divine
                    qualities exist. <br><br>

                    In the symbolic picture of the Ajna Chakra there is a Lotus with two petals, indicating that at this
                    level of consciousness there exists “only two”, Atma (Self ) and Paramatma(God). The Divinities of
                    Ajna Chakra are Shiva and Shakti united in one form. This means that in the Ajna Chakra
                    consciousness and Nature are already united, but have still not merged into total unity. <br><br>

                    The qualities of this Chakra are unity (Ekata), emptiness (Shunya), truth (Sat), Consciousness
                    (Chitt) and bliss (Ananda). The “eye of knowledge” opens within and we see the reality of the Self -
                    hence the term “third eye”, which is an attribute of Lord Shiva. The Ajna Chakra is the seat of the
                    “inner Master”. It indicates that wisdom and knowledge are realised in all actions. The egocentric
                    intellect has surrendered to the higher, ethical, reasoning power of discrimination (Viveka).
                    However a blockage in this Chakra has the opposite effect, diminishing one’s power of contemplation
                    and discrimination, resulting in confusion.

                <h2>The Characteristics of Ajna Chakra</h2>
                <h3>The color of Ajna Chakra</h3>

                <p>Ajna Chakra it is the sixth energy center of all the seven chakras. The balance of this chakra is
                    freedom of thought and expression. The color that reflects its concept is Indigo. The almost dark
                    blue hues or royal blue is associated with night. It also opens the door to the Divine. Indigo is
                    the color of wisdom and inner knowledge. It brings clarity to all the five senses in the body. The
                    color Indigo encourages the transformation of energies from the lower chakras into higher spiritual
                    vibrations.</p>

                <h3>Third-Eye Chakra symbol</h3>
                <p>The Ajna symbol is an OM positioned over an inverted triangle that is seated within a circle between
                    two lotus petals. This symbol contains two elements associated with wisdom: the upside-down triangle
                    and the lotus flower. It strongly supports the concept of supreme intelligence and spiritual
                    enlightenment. It channels the energy towards universal knowledge and is a gateway to higher
                    consciousness.</p>

                <h3>Ajna Chakra Imbalance</h3>

                <p>The increasing desire for material things disconnects us from our true Self. There is impatience,
                    expectations, burdens of the past, and many more negative thoughts that block our vision. This
                    distance from spirituality blurs our intuition and imbalances Ajna Chakra. Other aspects that
                    manifest are indecisiveness, confusion, lack of focus and purpose, or depression. The struggle to
                    reach your goals becomes even more difficult with self-doubt and narrow mindedness.</p>

                <p> An overactive Ajna is not that common since the physical reality is dominating in a modern
                    lifestyle. However, in unique circumstances, an overactive Third-Eye Chakra results in overwhelming
                    feelings. The psychic activities increase with instances of paranormal experiences. This can also
                    lead to hallucinations and complete dissociation from the real world.</p>

                <p>The physical symptoms of an imbalanced third eye chakra affect the neurons of the brain with problems
                    like:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Eye problems</li>
                    <li>Headache</li>
                    <li> Migraine</li>
                    <li>Brain disorders</li>
                    <li>Insomnia</li>
                    <li>Endocrine imbalance</li>
                    <li>Disorders in Pituitary and Pineal Gland, Hypothalamus</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Positive affirmations for Crown Chakra balance</h2>
                <p>Affirmations are the best technique for balancing the chakras. All of them aim to boost confidence
                    and faith in oneself without any judgments or Ego. These affirmations promote an open Third eye
                    Chakra.
