                    <h2>Swadhisthana Chakra - Sacral Chakra</h2>
                    <span>msva = Self shthana = place</span>

                    The Svadhishthana Chakra is situated at the lower end of the Sacrum. Its Mantra is VAM. <br><br>

                    The Svadhishthana Chakra marks the second level of our development. The evolution of consciousness
                    towards pure, human consciousness begins in the Svadhishthana Chakra. It is the seat of the
                    subconscious mind where all life experiences and impressions since the beginning of our existence in
                    the womb are stored. The Muladhara Chakra is the storehouse of our Karmas, however these are
                    activated in Svadhishthana Chakra.<br><br>

                    Awakening of the Svadhishthana Chakra brings clarity and development of the personality. But before
                    this can happen we must purify our consciousness of negative qualities. In the symbolic picture of
                    the Svadhishthana Chakra is a Lotus with six petals. These represent our negative qualities which
                    are to be overcome - anger, hatred, jealousy, cruelty, desire and pride. Other base qualities that
                    hinder our development are lethargy, fear, doubt, revenge, envy and greed.<br><br>

                    The animal designated to represent the Svadhishthana Chakra is the Crocodile. It symbolises
                    laziness, insensitivity and the danger that slumbers in this Chakra. The element of Svadhishthana is
                    Water, also a symbol of hidden danger. Water is soft and pliable, but also an immense power when out
                    of control. This is just how it is with the Svadhishthana Chakra. When negative emotions arise from
                    the subconscious to the conscious state, we can be completely put off balance.<br><br>

                    The Divinity of this Chakra is Brahma the Creator and his daughter Sarasvati, the Goddess of wisdom
                    and fine arts. The colour of Svadhishthana is orange, the colour of the sunrise, which is symbolic
                    of the rising consciousness. Orange is the colour of activity and purity. It indicates the positive
                    qualities that unfold in this Chakra such as joy, faith, self-confidence and energy.<br><br>

                    <h2> The Characteristics of the Svadhishthana Chakra</h2>

                    <h3>The flow of the water element</h3>
                    <p> Within the water element, there is an immense power of flow. This energy has to be regulated to
                        avoid any destructive consequences. When the Sacral Chakra is in balance, our emotions flow
                        through us without any judgments. Recognizing these emotions enhances our ability to understand
                        deeply and express our desires. This restores balance and harmony.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Balanced energy of the orange color</h3>
                    <p>The association with the orange color is symbolic of the rising consciousness just like a
                        sunrise. Orange is the color of activity and purity. It is in this chakra that we design the
                        life we want. The qualities that this color unfolds are joy, faith, self-confidence, and
                        balanced energy.</p>

                    <h3>The sexual energy of the Sacral Chakra</h3>
                    <p> Svadhishthana Chakra enables us to shape our desires. As the center of passion, the Sacral
                        Chakra awakens the power of creation. This allows a person to discover the power of choice and
                        create intimate relationships. Motivated by pleasure, Sacral Chakra promotes emotional
                        well-being. It plays an active role in our sexuality and the expression of our emotional needs
                        and desires.</p>

                    <h3>Emotional intimacy and relationships</h3>
                    <p> Svadhishthana Chakra is centered on personal identity and how it responds to the seductive
                        forces of the physical world. When the second chakra is unbalanced it causes emotionally
                        disturbed, irritable, lacking creativity, and obsessed with sexual thoughts. A balanced Sacral
                        Chakra has the ability to take risks and experience positivity and compassion.</p>

                    <h3>Signs of an underactive Sacral Chakra</h3>

                    <p>An underactive Sacral Chakra can affect the complete physical and mental wellbeing. When the
                        Sacral Chakra is blocked, feelings of lack of control ranging from uncertainty to an inability
                        to cope with lifeâ€™s changes permeate. The path to freely express desires also hinders artistic
                        abilities. Also, being dependent or co-dependent on other people creates a psychological
                        imbalance causing detachment from the self.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Fear of pleasure</li>
                        <li>Lack of creativity</li>
                        <li>Fatigue</li>
                        <li>Lack of desire</li>
                        <li>Insecurity</li>
                        <li>Detachment</li>
                        <li>Low libido</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Positive affirmations for Swadhisthana chakra balance</h2>
                    <p>Affirmations are a positive way to heal negative programming that can be embedded in the
                        subconscious. If there is negative programming present, then it is in itself the cause of chakra
                        imbalances. Affirmations can help to reprogram the subconscious with a positive mindset and
                        raise energy vibrations. Some affirmations that help alleviate Sacral Chakra include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I am passionate.</li>
                        <li>I am a creative being.</li>
                        <li>I have boundaries that protect me.</li>
