                <h2>Mannipura Chakra - Solar plexus</h2>
                <span>mani = jewel pura = place, city</span>

                The Manipura Chakra is situated behind the navel. Its Mantra is RAM. When our consciousness has reached
                the Manipura Chakra we have overcome the negative aspects of Svadhishthana. The Manipura Chakra contains
                many precious jewels such as the qualities of clarity, self-confidence, bliss, self-assurance,
                knowledge, wisdom and the ability to make correct decisions. <br><br>

                The colour of the Manipura Chakra is yellow. The animal designated to represent Manipura is the Ram. The
                corresponding element is Fire, therefore it is also known as the Fire or Sun Centre. The fire element
                manifests in the body as heat in the Solar Plexus. The Manipura Chakra is the centre of vitality. It
                controls our energy balance to strengthen and consolidate our health. This Chakra has an effect like a
                magnet, attracting Prana from the Cosmos.<br><br>

                As the seat of digestive fire, this Chakra regulates the function of the Pancreas and digestive organs.
                Blockages in this centre can cause many health problems such as digestive disorders, circulatory
                disease, diabetes and fluctuations in blood pressure. However, a strong and active Manipura Chakra
                greatly supports good health and assists us in overcoming many illnesses. When the energy of this Chakra
                flows freely, the effect is like that of a power station, constantly supplying vitality - bestowing
                balance and strength.<br><br>

                In the symbolic picture of the Manipura Chakra there is a Lotus with ten petals. These represent the ten
                Pranas, the vital forces, which control and nourish all functions of the human body. An additional
                symbol of the Manipura is that of a triangle with its tip pointing downward. This indicates the
                spreading of energy, growth and development. Activation of the Manipura Chakra frees one from negative
                energies and purifies and strengthens oneâ€™s vitality.<br><br>

                The Divinities of this Chakra are Vishnu and Lakshmi. Lord Vishnu is symbolic of the evolving human
                consciousness that no longer contains any animal characteristic. Goddess Lakshmi represents material and
                spiritual prosperity, which blossom and prosper with God's blessing.

                <h2> The Characteristics of the Manipura Chakra</h2>
                <h3>The energy of the yellow color</h3>
                <p> The color associated with the third of the seven chakras, the Manipura Chakra, is yellow. This color
                    symbolizes energy, intellect, and also the connection a person has with the Fire and Sun. The color
                    yellow also represents youth, new beginnings, birth, and re-birth. Yellow connects us with knowledge
                    and intellect. People who are drawn to the color yellow are interested in intellectual pursuits.</p>

                <h3>TThe element of fire</h3>
                <p>The associated element of Manipura Chakra is fire. It is also known as representing the energy of the
                    sun. The element fire ignites the light of consciousness that motivates us to strive towards success
                    and good health. Spending too much time in the third chakra can cause burn out. However, not
                    developing it can leave a person feeling weak, fearful, and inert. The feelings of love and
                    happiness that we feel in our hearts actually originate in the Solar Plexus Chakra and rise from
                    there to the Heart Chakra. <br><br>

                    The fire energy of the Solar Plexus Chakra is very important in digestion and in promoting efficient
                    absorption of nutrients.</p>
                <h3>Manipura Chakra and emotions</h3>
                <p> The fire element is represented in the body as heat or Agni in the solar plexus. At the center of
                    the physical and astral body, the Manipura Chakra attracts prana and manages this life energy in
                    order to balance the body and mind. Excessive fire, excessive energy in the Solar Plexus Chakra can
                    create impulsive reactions such as anger and aggression which is a sign of blocked chakra..</p>

            <article>

                <h3>Signs of a Blocked Manipura Chakra</h3>

                <p>When the Manipura Chakra is out of alignment, digestive issues arise. This can show up as improper
                    processing of nutrients, constipation, or irritable bowel syndrome. Eating disorders, Ulcers,
                    Diabetes, issues with the pancreas, liver, and colon are some of the symptoms of imbalance in this
                    energy center of Manipura Chakra.</p>

                <p> An imbalance can also cause severe emotional problems. Starting with doubt and mistrust towards the
                    people in your life, continuing with a lot of worries about what others may think about you. Some
                    people may experience low levels of self-esteem, searching for continuous confirmation and approval
                    from others. This imbalance may lead to unhealthy attachments to people in your life.</p>

                <p> Activating Manipura Chakra cultivates a willingness to gain insight into an understanding of power,
                    individuality, and identity. In some people, a misaligned Solar Plexus Chakra can make skillful
                    self-expression challenging. In some, it manifests as overly rigid or controlling behavior. In
                    others, it breeds a victim mentality, neediness, and lack of direction or self-esteem to stand up
                    and take positive action.</p>

                <h2>Positive affirmations for Manipura chakra balance</h2>

                    heads, or by writing them down, we help reverse negative thought patterns and replace them with
