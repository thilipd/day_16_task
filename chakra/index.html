                <h2>What are Chakras?</h2>
                <p>
                    Chakras are the energy centers of the body. They are located in the astral body, along the
                    spine,
                    starting at its base and running upwards to the crown of the head. The astral body is the energy
                    body
                    residing inside our physical body. Each physical body part has a corresponding astral body part.
                    The
                    astral body cannot be seen or touched. This is also a reason why we cannot see the chakras.
                    <br><br>

                    The chakras radiate a specific colour and energy, and each one coincides with a gland in the
                    physical
                    body. Since each chakra relates to specific spiritual, emotional, psychological, and physical
                    aspects of
                    our being, it is believed that their blockage or malfunction can lead to physical, psychological
                    and
                    emotional disorders. The conscious awareness and balancing of these energy centers, on the other
                    hand,
                    is believed to lead to well-being and good health.
                </p>

                <p>And that is one of the purposes of yoga. Through asana practice, yoga seeks to stimulate and
                    balance
                    these chakras or energy centers in the body. </p>

                <h2>What is the shape of a chakra? </h2>

                <p>There are many myths about the shape of the
                    chakras. Some say they are like whirling discs, while
                    others
                    believe they are like flowers hanging from the spine. Some people even think that they resemble
                    an
                    ice-cream cone! All these different ideas exist simply because the chakras cannot be seen by the
                    eyes or
                    by any device. So, we tend to believe whatever becomes commonly circulated. <br><br>

                    The ancient scriptures say that a chakra is shaped like a sphere or a ball. And it is even
                    believed
                    that
                    planet earth is a major chakra of the solar system and a minor chakra of our galaxy, the Milky
                    Way.
                    It
                    rotates to distribute some energy, but knowing more about this remains beyond the scope of the
                    human
                    imagination.</p>
                <h2>What is the size of a chakra? </h2>

                <p>Some people say that chakras are one foot in radius, while others say that they change their
                    size
                    according to the energy flow. Scriptures, on the other hand, tell us that the chakras are
                    very
                    small, as
                    they are located in the astral spinal cord, which is further located inside the physical
                    spinal
                    cord.

                <h2>Things you should know about Chakras </h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>1. Chakras alone won’t heal you</li>
                    <li>2. There are more than 7 chakras</li>
                    <li>3. Belief is everything when it comes to chakras</li>
                    <li>4. Each of the 7 chakras has its own intuition</li>
                    <li>5. A blocked chakra is not the main cause of health problems</li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Chakras alone won’t heal you</h3>
                <p>Chakras work on the level of consciousness
                    and their effectiveness depends on the level of
                    consciousness which is mostly on a higher level of consciousness. The energies heal, but this is
                    only a short-term solution and you need to have a long-term solution to your chakra energy
                    problems. <br><br>

                    You need to balance chakras, chakra healing techniques, and long term solutions as you find the
                    true cause of the problem with your chakra energy. A higher level of consciousness will enable
                    you to see a possible problem before it even reaches your energy centers which will then help
                    you find an effective solution.</p>

                <h3>There are more than 7 chakras</h3>
                <p>To determine the right system, you first need to understand that chakras aren’t like organs in
                    the physical body. Contrary to what many think, there are more than seven chakras, though the
                    seven are the most common. The seven chakras in the human energy body are represented by seven
                    colors and have a name and meaning. But, there are also other systems associated with how human
                    energy body works.</p>

                <h3>Belief is everything when it comes to chakras</h3>
                <p>Believing in everything, even that which you cannot see is very important. This is the same when
                    it comes to chakras. Because most people can’t see chakras they do not believe in them. The
                    chakra system explains more about energy flows in the human body that exist on the higher levels
                    of consciousness and you need to first believe that they exist for you to see and feel them.
                    Once your consciousness is high enough you will be able to notice their existence.</p>

                <h3>Each of the 7 chakras has its own intuition</h3>
                <p>Chakras are energy routers that connect you to a larger energy network. For you to make good use
                    of your chakras and your intuition you need to establish the communication with each energy
                    center of your body. With proper intuition towards understanding each individual chakra, you
                    will be able to create your own visualization techniques that would help you hear what your
                    chakras are trying to tell you as well as use them to your advantage.</p>

                <h3>A blocked chakra is not the main cause of health problems</h3>
                <p> Though blocked chakras have an effect on your health they aren’t always the major cause of your
                    health issues. Blocked chakras are caused when there is no energy flow on the higher levels of
                    consciousness.</p>

                <p>Even with the presence of these chakras, in case one of your chakras is either too open or too
                    closed, then this has a negative impact on your health. Learn more about the 7 chakras and tune
                    in with the natural energy cycles of your body. This information will help you to connect all
                    the physical, emotional and spiritual imbalances with the chakras that empower them and enable
                    you to balance your chakras and live a healthy and harmonious life.</p>
