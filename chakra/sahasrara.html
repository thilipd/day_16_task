                <p>

                    <span>Sahasrara = thousand, infinite</span>
                    The Sahasrara Chakra is located on the top of the head. It is also known as the “Thousand-Petalled
                    Lotus”, “Brahmarandhra” (the door to God) or the “Centre of a Million Rays” because it radiates like
                    the
                    Sun. No other light comes close to the brilliance of the Sun. In the same way, the energy and
                    radiation
                    of all other Chakras pale in the radiance of the Sahasrara Chakra. <br><br>




                    In the Sahasrara Chakra exists an important power - Medha Shakti. Medha Shakti is a hormone that
                    influences brain functions such as memory, concentration and intelligence. Yoga exercises can
                    activate
                    and strengthen Medha Shakti.<br><br>

                    The Sahasrara has no special colour or quality. It is pure light, which contains all colours. The
                    energy
                    of all Nadis unites in this centre, like the waters of a thousand rivers pouring into the sea. Here
                    is
                    the seat of Shiva, the Supreme Self. The awakening of the Sahasrara Chakra means revelation of
                    Divine
                    Splendour and attainment of Supreme Consciousness. Just as night disappears with the rising of the
                    Sun,
                    ignorance fades with the awakening of the Sahasrara Chakra.<br><br>

                    This Chakra represents the goal of Yoga, Self-Realisation and God-Realisation, where the individual
                    soul
                    unites with Cosmic Consciousness. One who gains this is liberated from all Karmas and achieves
                    Moksha -
                    complete liberation from the cycle of rebirth and death. In meditation the Yogi reaches Nirvikalpa
                    Samadhi (the highest level of Samadhi) at the Sahasrara Chakra, where the mind finally comes to
                    complete
                    stillness and finds fulfilment in the union of knowledge, the knower and the object of
                    knowledge.<br><br>


                    In the Sahasrara Chakra the thousand-petalled Lotus blooms as a symbol of complete, unfolding
                    Consciousness. The Divinity of this Chakra is Shiva in the form of pure, Supreme Consciousness. The
                    corresponding element is Adi Tattva, the Supreme, spiritual Tattva. The Mantra is the same as for
                    Agya
                    Chakra, the original sound OM.

                <h2>Characteristics of a balanced Crown Chakra</h2>
                <p> The Sahasrara Chakra activates, it brings a more
                    positive
                    outlook on life. There are visible
                    changes in our habits and attitude. The Self is no longer ruled by the ego. Emotions like gratitude,
                    compassion, and acceptance become our true Self. It is a rejection of all negative thoughts that
                    bring unhappiness and stress in our lives. A balanced Crown Chakra brings spiritual understanding
                    and peace with a clear perspective. When the Crown Chakra is unbalanced or blocked, he or she may
                    experience disillusionment, boredom, melancholy, and restlessness.</p>

                <h2> Signs of a Blocked Crown Chakra</h2>
                <p>The biggest challenge of the Crown Chakra is on a mental level; when someone is too withdrawn and
                    attached to the materialistic pursuits of this existence as well as stuck in their way of thinking.
                    A person with blocked a Crown Chakra may experience unwillingness to be open to other ideas,
                    thoughts, or knowledge. The signs such as psychosis, dissociation from the body, being disconnected
                    and ungrounded are also manifested when the Crown Chakra is unbalanced. This chakra can produce
                    different symptoms depending on excessive or insufficient activity.</p>
